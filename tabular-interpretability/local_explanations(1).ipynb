    "\n",
    "SHAP dependence plots show the effect of a single feature across the whole dataset. They plot a feature’s value vs. the SHAP value of that feature across many samples. SHAP dependence plots may look similar to partial dependence plots, but account for the interaction effects present in the features, and are only defined in regions of the input space supported by data. The vertical dispersion of SHAP values at a single feature value is driven by interaction effects, and another feature is chosen for coloring to highlight possible interactions.\n",
