# XAI-Interpretability-Lab
This repository contains a suite of techniques for inspecting and interpreting machine learning models. The goal is to move beyond "black box" predictions and understand the underlying logic of both traditional and deep learning architectures.

🏗️ Project Components
🌍 Global and Counterfactual Explanations
Global Interpretability: Implementation of Partial Dependence Plots and ALE Plots to interpret Random Forest behavior.

Counterfactuals: Simulating "what-if" scenarios by finding the smallest change to input features that results in a different model outcome.

🔎 Deep Learning & Latent Space
GAN Dissection: Techniques for inspecting layers and interpreting the function of specific units within Generative Adversarial Networks.

Embedding Visualization: Dimensionality reduction using PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP to make high-dimensional latent spaces meaningful and interpretable.
